# project_LifeExpectancy(WHO)
### Project Overview
This project performs statistical analysis on factors influencing life expectancy using WHO data from 2000-2015 for 193 countries. The study examines immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors, and other health-related determinants of life expectancy.

### Dataset
The dataset combines health indicators from WHO's Global Health Observatory and economic data from the United Nations. After cleaning, the final dataset contains:

2938 observations (rows)

22 variables (columns)

Data spanning 2000-2015

### Key Variables
Target Variable: Life expectancy

### Predictor Categories:

Immunization factors (Hepatitis B, Polio, Diphtheria)

Mortality factors (infant/child/adult mortality rates)

Economic factors (GDP, expenditure on health)

Social factors (education, alcohol consumption, BMI)

Other health factors (HIV/AIDS, thinness, etc.)

### Research Questions
This analysis aims to answer:

Which factors significantly affect life expectancy?

Should countries with low life expectancy (<65) increase healthcare spending?

How do infant/adult mortality rates impact life expectancy?

What is the correlation between lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol) and lifespan?

How does education affect life expectancy?

What is the relationship between population density and life expectancy?

How does immunization coverage influence life expectancy?
